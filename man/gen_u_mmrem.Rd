\usage{
gen_u_mmrem(.n_sch, .resid_var = 0.2, .seedling = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.n_sch}{Numeric scalar. Gives the total number of schools in the
dataset. The variance-covariance matrix for predictor z will have dimensions
\code{.n_sch x .n_sch}.}

\item{.resid_var}{A numeric scalar. Gives the residual variance of u0j (i.e.,
the variance unexplained after controlling for the school-level predictor,
z). Defaults to 0.2.}

\item{.seedling}{A numeric scalar. Gives the seed for random number
generation. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to \code{\link{gen_z_varcov}}.}
}
\value{
This function returns a dataframe with four elements: "sch_id",
the ID variable (equal to \code{seq_len(.n_sch)}); "u_residual", the random
intercept residual term for each school (equal to predictor_z + v_residual);
"z_predictor", the value of the school-level predictor, z, for each school;
and "v_residual", the residual term for "u_residual" (i.e., the residual
after predicting u_residual from z_predictor) for each
school. Each element is vector with length equal to \code{.n_sch}.
}
\description{
This function generates the residual term for the random slope in the
multiple membership random effects model used in this simulation
study. To construct a random effect that is correlated across clusters,
a predictor, z, is generated with variance-covariance matrix built by
\code{\link{gen_z_varcov}}. The cluster-correlated predictor is then used
in this function to predict the random slope residual, u0j, with explained
variance given by \code{clust_cov} (an argument passed to
\code{gen_z_varcov}) and unexplained variance given by \code{.resid_var}.
Because no other school-level predictors will be used in this simulation,
total variance of the random intercept should be
\code{clust_cov[1] + .resid_var}.
}
\details{
NOTE: this function relies on the \code{\link[MASS]{mvrnorm}} and
\code{\link{gen_z_varcov}}, and \code{\link{is_off_diag}} functions, the
first two of which (especially \code{mvrnorm}) get quite clunky when matrix
sizes are large. Make sure that \code{.n_sch} is given a reasonable value to
avoid this. In testing, it seems that 1000 works slowly, 2000 is very slow,
and any more than that brings things to a complete halt.

desired - see \code{gen_z_varcov} for more info)
